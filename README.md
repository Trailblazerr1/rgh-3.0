# rgh-3.0
Rajasthan Hackathon 3.0   



App: JobSquare   

Idea:   
We have made an online platform which facilitates job search for non-regular wage earners as well as helping the hirers to find a fitting person for their work. 
In other words, its a platform for temporary blue collar jobs (painting, carepentry or cleaning) in your area, both hirers and seekers.   

Motivation:   
Of the total employed, 32.8 percent are casual labourers and 3.7 percent are contract workers, says the Fifth Annual Employment Unemployment Survey 2015-16 conducted by the Labour Bureau, which accounts to about 45 crore Indian citizens.
On a smaller scale, most Indian state have almost half of the workers engaged in casual labor. So, starting from a lesser focus (a state or two), we can have a total market of 45 crore.
